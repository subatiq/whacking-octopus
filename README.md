## Disclaimer
The code is really shitty and I probably will not care about it any time soon. Never try to learn anything from this code. It's nasty.

## Demo

## Hardware

It's pretty simple, you connect your 16x2 I2C LCD to the controller, add two buttons as a digital input and that's it. 

I'll add pictures if someone will care. If you want some schemas, feel free to contact me.
